#### What
My personal portfolio site / Hugo theme. I've tried a lot of static site generators. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) was the starting point, but I never really did much of anything with those early experiments. [Roots](http://roots.cx) caught my eye, followed by [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Eventually, I settled on [Harp](https://harpjs.com) because of the built in preprocessors. I built a few sites using Harp, and bounced around hosting on Dreamweaver, Digital Ocean, Surge, Netlify, and AWS. They all had their pros and cons, except for Dreamweaver which was all cons. Eventually I decided to start from the ground up, and went back to Hugo with Gulp as a task-runner.

This theme/site is built using Hugo and Photoswipe. It has a blog with functional tagging/taxonomy, a single-page image gallery with lazyloading, thumbnails generated with Primitive, and a whole bunch of flexbox goodness.
