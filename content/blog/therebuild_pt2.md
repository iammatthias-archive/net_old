Last time I posted I was pretty excited. I had configured a pretty sweet AWS setup that I was pushing to with Gulp, and my site was starting to look pretty cool. And then I did... something? I'm not sure what. But I lost some data on git due to a series of bad merges, and lost the local files when the external drive they were on decided to die.

So I started over.

Again.

But it worked out for the best - during the first part of my site rebuild I learned a lot about Hugo - but I also did a lot of things inefficiently. None of it was really a deal breaker, but it could be improved. My new folder hierarchy is a lot more organized, and I simplified the number of partials.

This is what is recommended on the Hugo docs, and what formed the basis of the first round of the rebuild:
```

```
A lot of the folders, like `Archetype`, `data`, `layouts`, and `static` seemed a bit redundant to me - I don't really need defaults, it's all defined in my theme. So I removed them, and pointed to the folders in my theme in my `config.yaml`.

```
archetypeDir:               "themes/iammatthias_v2/archetypes"
dataDir:                    "themes/iammatthias_v2/data"
layoutDir:                  "themes/iammatthias_v2/layouts"
staticDir:                  "themes/iammatthias_v2/static"
```
Nice.

Now what about deployment? I was pretty excited about getting everything set up on AWS. It's a fantastic service. But this is a simple, static site. Did I really need the complexity that is AWS for something so simple? Nope. Admittedly, the deployment/hosting option I settled on is still a bit overkill. I moved to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). I received an email offering me $300 towards [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cloud-console), which piqued my interest enough to get me to look into the services they offer. It's pretty great, the CLI is straightforward, and the documentation does a decent job of approaching plain english - which makes it really easy to quickly pick up the process.

After playing with GCP for a bit, I ended up on the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) page, and was pretty intrigued. Super simple hosting with free SSL for custom domains? Sign me up.

Now I run `publish` which is set in my .zshrc as an alias for `gulp build && hugo && firebase deploy && rm -rf public`. The deploy itself is pretty slow - longest I've seen so far is 18 minutes. But hopefully that improves over time - there's been an [open ticket on Github](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/133) that's received a few updates over the last year.

So that's where I am. A design I'm really happy with, an organized code base, and an easy-to-configure deployment setup.
