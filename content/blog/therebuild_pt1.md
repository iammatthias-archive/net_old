# I rebuilt my site. Again.

 Around this time last year I finished rebuilding it as well. HarpJS was the static site generator of choice for a long time, but I recently made the jump to Hugo. That meant relearning, and redesigning some aspects of my site. It also took a lot longer than I thought. But here are some of the cool things that developed along the way.

## Hugo

Hugo is great. It's built in Go, and it's super fast. The folder hierarchy was a bit confusing a first, but I quickly wrapped my head around the way content is divorced from the markdown. Hugo also packages in a "live reload" function, which was super helpful while building this site. I started with my own "theme" so that future updates will (hopefully) be plug+play with an updated theme. We'll see how that goes when the time comes.

## Gulp

I always shied away from task runners like Grunt and Gulp. Part of it was that HarpJS handled the preprocessing for me, and part of it was that I just didn't want to learn *yet another tool*. But it was a necessary evil if I wanted to use Hugo with preprocessors like Sass. Turns out, it's not such an evil. The way it pipes assets is remarkably intuitive, and it speeds up a lot of the build process.

## AWS

My first website, a horrible Lightroom 2 generated Flash site, was hosted on a horrible shared hosting plan through GoDaddy. I stayed with them for longer than I should, then Digital Ocean caught my eye. They were great, I used them for my first hand-coded site, then a much nicer site built on Ghost. Then I had a brief affair with Github Pages, Surge.Sh, and Netlify. All good. All really good. But my site has a lot of images, and I just did not feel right abusing those fantastic free platforms with all of my stuff. So I decided to put on my big boy boots and dive into AWS. The end goal is a set up where I can push the [entire root directory to one bucket, build through Lambda, then output to a static site bucket](http://bezdelev.com/post/hugo-aws-lambda-static-website/). But I'm having issues with Lambda, so I settled for using Gulp to pipe the build directory to the static bucket. Works nicely. But that will be the first thing I really tackle as an ~~update~~ upgrade for my site.
