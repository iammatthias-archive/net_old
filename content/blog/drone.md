Drones are a tricky subject. There is a lot of controversy, and for good reason. There are [legitimate](https://iamkj.us/2pWdodN) [privacy concerns](https://iamkj.us/2pGr8IR), and [plenty](https://iamkj.us/2p3LJ68) [examples of](https://iamkj.us/2qqFCgK) [reckless](https://iamkj.us/2qqDAgN) [drone](https://iamkj.us/2pGsqnb) [usage](https://iamkj.us/2qqzpBF). But drones also present some amazing opportunities, and allow for an different point of view.

Last month I purchased the [DJI Mavic Pro](http://amzn.to/2qwLylu) [Fly More Package](http://amzn.to/2qwIfLm). It is a fantastic kit that comes with everything you need for a day of flying. Multiple batteries, a charging hub, car charger, USB Battery Pack adaptor, extra props, and a nifty carrying case that holds all the bits and pieces. I've been enjoying it so far.

I flew up and down and empty stretch of beach for a short period of time while getting used the feeling of piloting remotely. This thing is a blast to fly, the controls are intuitive and the DJI app packs in a lot of useful features. I'm looking forward to posting some of my POI and "Follow Me" experiments sometime in the near future.

It was pretty windy at El Capitan, which made flying a little difficult. At one point the drone was drifting left due to a strong gust. I landed after that and called it a day - though not before grabbing a drone #selfie.


I flew two days later at Sarah's Vineyard in Gilroy, California. If you're ever there, try the Pinot Noir – it's one of my favorites. Flying over the vineyard was a fun experience. The repeating patterns and color variations were something special – something I look forward to photographing again. ![Sarah's Vineyard](/assets/photos/blog/20170415_drone_002.jpg)
