I went out at sunset and found a small rock formation a little ways of shore. The waves were pounding on the rocks with a gentle slowness that seemed in pace with the setting sun. It was time for a short flight with the [Mavic Pro](http://amzn.to/2qwLylu).

Laying down a blanket on the beach gave me a safe place to take off and land without damaging the rotors with sand. The drone went up and out, and soon it was above the rocks with a birds-eye view of the waves.

It was time to try something new. Keeping the drone stationary over the rocks, I began to film. 1 minute of full 4K footage of the waves rolling over the rocks while the white water churned. This video file was imported into Photoshop with the frames as individual layers, and then they were blended together to create something new.

The end result looks like something dreamt up by Google's Deep Dream. It has a Van Gogh effect to the color and shape of the image. This is something I can't wait to try again.
