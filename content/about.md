description1 : "Photographer, content creator, marketer currently working for [Surf Air](http://fly.surfair.com/matthias.jordan). My background includes a BA in Photography from Brooks Institute, traditional design, and some front-end chops."
description2 : "In my free time, I take a lot of pictures, and cook a lot of food. Sometimes the two coincide, and I end up with a new post over on [C Breezy](https://cbreezy.kitchen). If it's the summer, I can usually be found near the beach or manning a grill."
description3: "My fianc√© is pretty rad, and we have a pup named Gatsby - a mini Aussie Shep who does his darnedest to terrorize every squirrel in existence. It's a serious job, and someone has to do it."
