description1 : "I create content and work between Product and Marketing at Surf Air. My background includes a BA in Photography from Brooks Institute, traditional design, and some front-end chops."
description2 : "In my free time, I take a lot of pictures, and cook a lot of food. Sometimes the two coincide, and I end up with a new post over on C Breezy. If it's the summer, I can usually be found near the beach or manning a grill."
description3: "My girlfriend is pretty rad, and we have a pup named Gatsby - a mini Aussie Shep who does his darnedest to terrorize every squirrel in existence. It's a serious job, and someone has to do it."
