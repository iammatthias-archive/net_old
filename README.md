# .com

The previous version of `iammatthias.com` was built using HarpJS. I like Harp, but started running into some issues. This is a rebuild/redesign using Hugo.

## Getting Started

Implement Hugo as the static site generator of choice, with the intention of pairing with a service like Forestry.io for a Hugo based flat file cms in the cloud.

### Goodies

Modular themes, Photoswipe, Bulma CSS, etc.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
